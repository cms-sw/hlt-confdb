<h1>HLT ConfDB GUI</h1>

<h3>Click <a href="start.jnlp">here</a> to start the HLT ConfDB GUI via Java Web Start</h3>

<p>The HLT ConfDB GUI is a signed Java application; the signing certificate was granted by the
<a href="https://ca.cern.ch/ca/">CERN Certification Authority</a> to the "CMS ConfDB" account.<br>
To verify the certificate, please install the <a href="https://cafiles.cern.ch/cafiles/certificates/CERN%20Root%20Certification%20Authority%202.crt">
CERN Root Certification Authority 2 Certificate</a>.</p>

<h3>Building the GUI</h3>
<p>You will need the <code>git</code> client, the <code>ant</code> build tool, and a Java 1.8 JDK installed:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/cms-sw/hlt-confdb.git
cd hlt-confdb
ant clean
./start
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Connection details</h3>
<p>In order to work, the GUI needs to connect to one of the Oracle database at CERN.<br>
The offline database <b>HLTDEVv2</b> should be accessible from the CERN network and from all (most?) institutes
that belong to the CMS collaboration.<br>
The online database <b>DAQv2</b> is accessible only from the .CMS network at Point 5, while its read-only
copy <b>ORCOFFv2</b> is accessible from the CERN network. An ssh tunnel can be used to connect from outside.</p>

<p>You can test the connection to the offline database with
<pre>
telnet cmsr1-s.cern.ch 10121
</pre>
If the output is something like
<pre>
Trying 10.116.96.139...
Connected to db-rac-349.cern.ch.
Escape character is '^]'.
</pre>
then you can connect to the database.<br>
If the output is something like
<pre>
Trying 10.116.96.139...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
</pre>
then you cannot connect directly to the database, and you need to use a tunnel.<br>
<p>If you are working from an institute outside CERN, please write to
Katarzyna Dziedziniewicz-Wojcik (Kate) with cms-trigger coordinators in +cc providing the IP address range for your institute,
and ask to allow it through the CMS database firewall.</p>

<p> Note 1) before doing this, it would be better to pop into HLT user support channel on the TSG mattermost linked on  <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/TriggerStudies"> our TriggerStudies twiki</a> under "Getting help"

<p> Note 2) its probably easier just to tunnel the connection than do this</p>

<h3>Connection through a tunnel</h3>
<p>Currently the preferred method to connect is to create a dynamic
forwarding through an ssh connection to lxplus:
<pre>
ssh -f -N -D 1080 lxplus.cern.ch
</pre>
then start the GUI, select the HLTDEVv2 (socks tunnel) option<br>
Change the proxy port number if you used a different local port. </p>

<p>Note we currently are seeing instances of this not working when running via the prebuilt GUI  while it works on the locally compiled version. In this case, either locally compile or note it is it is also possible to forward a port.
Forward the local port 10121 to the database server through an ssh connection to lxplus:
<pre>
ssh -f -N -L 10121:10.116.96.139:10121 lxplus.cern.ch
</pre>
then start the GUI, select the HLTDEVv2 (direct tunnel) option.
Change the server port number if you used a different local port.
</p>

If you have problems, please again stop by HLT user support mattermost channel linked on  <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/TriggerStudies"> our TriggerStudies twiki</a> under "Getting help"
